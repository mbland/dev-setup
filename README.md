# Mike Bland's dotfiles and setup scripts

**WORK IN PROGRESS** At the moment, there is absolutely no guarantee that things
will work as they should, as I'm actively hacking on it to see how everything
should work together. Many of the `scripts/` may end up as
[mbland/go-script-bash](https://github.com/mbland/go-script-bash) plugins.

This is a collection of dotfiles and setup scripts that I like to take with me
from system to system.
